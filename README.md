# AdventOfCode2021

:christmas_tree::christmas_tree::christmas_tree:

This is where I'm going to attempt to complete all of the 25 problems during the Advent of Code for 2021 using python!

The individual problems will be in directories labelled 01-25 corresponding to the problem of that specific day during the event.

:santa::santa::santa:

inputs for the different days are found in the inputs folder

Hope you all have a wonderful festive season!
